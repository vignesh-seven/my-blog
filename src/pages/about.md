Hello! I am Vignesh Tirupathi, Computer Science Student from India. 
This is my personal blog website I made to test and improve my web development skills and learn more about static site generators, frontend frameworks and JavaScript.
As for the content in this blog, it is mainly about my progress as a developer and sometimes about my hobbies and stuff.
