Today I finally decided on what colors I am going to use for this blog. I've settled on a warm feeling color scheme with dark red and yellow kind of shades. It looks warm to the eye and also looks premium (unintentionally, don't know why).

It is a pretty simple scheme, I mean there are only two colors involved lol. But I might change it if I get any better color ideas.

I am also working on a dark theme, but it might not be the next thing I do.
