Today, I made my blog available to the everyone. I uploaded it to GitHub and setup GitHub Pages to host the blog. It is available at https://vignesh-seven.github.io/my-blog/

This current version is just a modified version of an Astro template, but I am looking forward to adding more cool stuff in the near future.
