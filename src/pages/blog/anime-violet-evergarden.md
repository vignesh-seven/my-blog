The reason why I decided to watch Violet Evergarden is the drip. That dress, just look at her dress, I'm a sucker for good looking outfits, and this is just jaw dropping. And as soon as I started watching it, I was hit with some of the best visuals I've ever seen. And I already knew the production value of this thing is no joke. So, I binged the whole series in 2 days. It's got great music, amazing art, some of the scenes just make real life look like 360p, like, seriously, these frames are no joke.

The story revolves around the concept of love & writing letters, we follow Violet, who is currently in a job to write letters for other people, and trying to understand what love is. On the surface both of which sound like cheesy topics that only your grandma would be interested in. But the story manages to keep both of them intriguing. The letters aspect of the story helps Violet understand the meaning of love and the side stories make us reconstruct our own understanding of love with with every episode. With these side stories we piece together the meaning of love along with Violet, as she meets people that have experienced all kinds of love.  
   
If there's one word to describe this show perfectly, then I'd say it's "beautiful", in true sense of the word.  
The art style, the animation, the soundtrack, the characters, the concept, the story, everything is so beautiful. It's not just as beautiful to make you appreciate it while you're experiencing it, but also every time you remember it.

The story not only focuses on the beautiful and magical side of love, but also explores the responsibilities that come with being in love. Unlike most stories that end with the couple saying "I love you" this story starts with the phrase already said and takes you on a path to explore and digest the meanings and weights behind the saying.

With each episode, the story presents the pros & cons of love, not only the positive aspects of it but also the serious side of love. Like how love keeps you moving forward, even if you think you've lost everything. Not only that but also how love can break your heart and push you into endless despair. Love can give you courage, enough courage to make you risk being rejected. But it can also scare you enough to make you run away if you're not accepted. Love is really easy express. But it's easy to fake, so it's also very easy to be deceived & betrayed by love. Love can give you strength to live. But it can also make you stupid & ignore basic logic. Every side story is written to make you care about the characters in just one episode, and cry along with them by the end of it.

And the story makes sure to hit you with enough emotional damage to make you cry, in every episode. This is not a typical love story, this story does not play with characters that are in love, but it plays with just the bare intuition of love that's inside you. In other words, it's not a love story, it's a story of about love itself.
