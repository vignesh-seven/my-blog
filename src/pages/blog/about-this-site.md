As I am in my (almost) final year of my Computer Science degree, I wanted to make something that I could show as proof of what I learned. And make some projects that I could show to anyone like interviewers, lecturers, friends etc. So, I decided to start my developer journey with a blog website.

The goal is simple. Make a blog website with the following features:
 - Looks pretty.
 - Easy to make new posts without needing to touch the actual code of the website.
 - Easy to maintain, change the look and feel of the website in the future.
 - Has some content instead of just Lorem text or just a single page unlike my previous projects.
 - Using a static site generator for blazingly fast speed.
